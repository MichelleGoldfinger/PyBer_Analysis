#PyBer Analysis
##1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

V. Isualize at PyBer, has given me new assignment. Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

###2. Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

For this analysis see DataFrame image and multiple line chart in the attached PyBer Analysis Deliverable 3 pages file.
